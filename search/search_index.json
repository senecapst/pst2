This feature is intended to help divide up resources between multiple physical or logical locations of infrastructure. If all equipment will be installed in one central data center, all camera groups can be added to one single site. This is the default assumption by the tool for new projects. To assign camera groups to a site: 1. Name the site with a useful name 2. Click the drop-down and select which camera groups to assign. 3. Remove pre-assigned camera groups by using the 'X' in the black button. 4. Use the 'Add New Site' button to add additional sites as needed and repeat steps 1 and 2 Note The same camera group can be assigned to multiple sites! At the completion of this task, each unique site will shows its contribution to the Total Project Bandwidth, Storage and Camera count.
